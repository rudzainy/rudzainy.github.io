<!-- Grid Container for Card Layout -->
<section class="grid-container">
  <!-- Place card components inside this container -->
  <!-- Example: -->
  <!-- Include _card-1x1.html, _card-2x1.html, etc. here -->
</section>

<!-- Notes:
  - The grid-container class creates a responsive CSS grid layout
  - Cards inside will automatically arrange based on their size classes
  - 1x1 cards will be square
  - Other card layouts (2x1, 1x2, 2x2) will fill the appropriate grid spaces
  - Grid automatically adjusts columns based on screen size
  - Gap between cards is handled automatically
