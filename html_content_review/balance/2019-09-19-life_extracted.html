 and take actions for something that,  <br> 
 in your heart,  <br> 
 you truly believe is right. <br> 
There’s zero doubt. <br> 
No regrets.</p>

<p>It’s not so easy though  <br> 
 to say yes  <br> 
 and choose the lesser evil  <br> 
 between two wrongs.  <br> 
However,   <br> 
 deep down  <br> 
 you believe that actions  <br> 
 need to be taken. <br> 
You dip your hands  <br> 
 into the gutter.</p>

<p>It has to be done. <br> 
You take  <br> 
 every  <br> 
 bit  <br> 
 of responsibility  <br> 
 for your actions.</p>

<p>It’s even harder to stay silent. <br> 
Because you know that you will never be able to live with yourself  <br> 
 if you say yes  <br> 
 to a wrong.  <br> 
You understand  <br> 
 that you may never find peace. <br> 
But you endure,  <br> 
 keeping everything inside until one day,  <br> 
 hopefully,  <br> 
 your silence is heard.</p>

<p>Ultimately,  <br> 
 the decision is yours alone to make.  <br> 
 Do what you believe in your heart is right. <br> 
When you do,  <br> 
 God willing,  <br> 
 it will be the right decision.</p>
