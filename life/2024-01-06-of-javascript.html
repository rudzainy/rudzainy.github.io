<h2 id="prologue">Prologue</h2>

<p>I was learning HCI on the Web, jumping between fast-moving trains of different domain knowledges. It was not long before I got overwhelmed with the number of trains and railways criss-crossing the Web. I took a step back, and decided to go out on a journey to build my own train.</p>

<h2 id="the-first-sighting">The First Sighting</h2>

<p>My first encounter happened very early during my journey. I was looking for ways to animate stuff on a web page, when suddenly a wild JavaScript appear!</p>

<p>I was young and impatient. 
I sang to myself “Gotta catch ‘em all!”</p>

<p>I tried picking it up, but it was Super Ineffective!…</p>

<p>… .. .</p>

<p>I was young and impatient. 
I ran away from the battle.</p>

<p>I got JavaScript entered into my Dɪˈvel.ə.pərdex. That is always a win in my book.</p>

<h2 id="the-hunt">The Hunt</h2>

<p>Fast forward to 2015, I was out looking for tools and encountered a wild ES5. And lo behold, it was the same wild JavaScript I encountered years before! It seemed to have evolved since I last saw it.</p>

<p>That’s when I saw it with my own eyes – JavaScript evolving!</p>

<p>I was young and dumb (I have learned patience). 
I was determined to tame it.</p>

<p>I camped out and observed as it evolves.
Every now and then, I try picking it up, but each attempt was still Super Ineffective…</p>

<p>I was young and dumb.
I was determined to tame it.</p>

<p>Every time I failed, I made sure to update my Dɪˈvel.ə.pərdex. “Live to fight another day”, I told myself.</p>

<p>I observed some more until one day, during my last battle with JavaScript, I came to a sudden realization.</p>

<h2 id="the-farewell">The Farewell</h2>

<p>I recalled the origin story of JavaScript. There were legends and there were historical facts. I considered it for a bit.</p>

<p>“JavaScript belongs in the wild. That was how I encountered it in the first place.”</p>

<p>I learned wisdom!</p>

<p>With a satisfied smile, I ran away from the battle for the last time. I packed and updated my Dɪˈvel.ə.pərdex and moved forward on my journey.</p>

<p>I was young and hopeful.
I left JavaScript there. 
In the wild.</p>

<h2 id="epilogue">Epilogue</h2>

<p>While looking for tools, I managed to pick up a wild but tame Ruby. I brought it along my journey and kept it close with me. Who would have known, it turns out that as my Ruby matures, it also became Super Effective on Rails!</p>

<p>I’m almost done with my train building journey now. 
I will bring Ruby on Rails to meet JavaScript soon, with the hope that I will finally be able pick it up.</p>

<p>Legend says that JavaScript is still evolving.</p>
