Title: Nurturing Future Web Developers: My Journey as a Mentor at NEXT Academy</p>

<p>Introduction:</p>

<p>From October 2015 to October 2017, I had the privilege of serving as a mentor at NEXT Academy in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia. This article delves into my experiences and the significant responsibilities I undertook during this time, both as a mentor for their 9-week coding bootcamp and as a Front End Web Developer. I had the opportunity to guide and support aspiring web developers through their intensive training, while also contributing to the development and maintenance of web applications for NEXT Academy. This article outlines the topics covered in the boot camp, my daily tasks as a developer, and the valuable takeaways from this enriching experience.</p>

<p>Joining NEXT Academy as a Mentor:</p>

<p>My journey at NEXT Academy began when I enrolled in their 9-week coding bootcamp, immersing myself in a rigorous training program to enhance my web development skills. After successfully completing the bootcamp, I was offered the opportunity to stay on as a mentor. The experience I gained as a student provided me with valuable insights into the challenges and learning needs of aspiring web developers.</p>

<p>Mentoring Students in the Bootcamp:</p>

<p>As a mentor, I had the privilege of guiding students through the intensive 9-week bootcamp. Throughout the program, I provided support, guidance, and feedback to help them grasp the fundamental concepts and technologies necessary to excel in web development. The bootcamp covered various topics, including Ruby, ActiveRecord, Basic HTML &amp; CSS, Basic JavaScript, Sinatra framework, and Ruby on Rails framework. By leveraging my knowledge and experience, I aimed to empower students to build a strong foundation in these essential areas.</p>

<p>Influence on 14 Intakes:</p>

<p>During my tenure as a mentor, I had the opportunity to guide and mentor a total of 14 intakes. Witnessing the growth and progress of each student was immensely rewarding. By fostering a supportive and collaborative learning environment, I encouraged students to embrace challenges, explore their creativity, and develop a deep understanding of web development principles. Through personalized guidance and continuous feedback, I aimed to instill confidence and inspire their passion for coding.</p>

<p>Front End Web Developer Role:</p>

<p>In addition to my responsibilities as a mentor, I also worked as a Front End Web Developer at NEXT Academy. This role allowed me to apply my skills in a practical setting and contribute to the development and maintenance of web applications. On a daily basis, I was involved in building new features, reviewing pull requests, and resolving bugs. Working in a team setting, I collaborated with fellow developers and designers to create seamless and visually appealing web experiences.</p>

<p>My time as a mentor and developer at NEXT Academy provided me with valuable insights and takeaways. One of the most important lessons was the significance of teamwork and collaboration. Working alongside talented individuals, I gained a deeper understanding of the importance of effective communication, coordination, and shared goals in achieving project success.</p>

<p>Moreover, being exposed to diverse technologies enriched my skill set and broadened my perspective. Working with Ruby on Rails apps, ReactJS frameworks, and various APIs allowed me to gain hands-on experience in different areas of web development, enabling me to adapt and stay up-to-date with the rapidly evolving tech landscape.</p>

<p>Conclusion:</p>

<p>My experience as a mentor and Front End Web Developer at NEXT Academy was a transformative and fulfilling journey. Guiding students through the coding bootcamp and contributing to web application development provided me with a deeper understanding of the challenges and opportunities in the field of web development.
