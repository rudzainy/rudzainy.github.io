A friend reached out to me for a quick job. I accepted also thinking it would be a quick job. Boy were we both on for a ride!

## Backgound

The International Aid Campaign (IAC), led by EHEE, aims to raise awareness and provide assistance to the Muslim Ummah and suffering populations worldwide. They've organized four major aid events: "Help Syria Maldives," "Help Rohingya Maldives" (2017), "Ghouta Emergency Relief," and "With Love to GAZA" (2018), all executed by a committed team of volunteers.

The task was to do an entire design refresh for IAC's website. My friend had done most of the work. He asked me to finish up a few more pages.

## Defining Users

- IAC has many types of programs and campaigns
- different user types
  - new users
    - needs guidance
    - tech savvy
  - returning users
    - browsing around
    - ready to take action

IAC encompasses a diverse array of programs and campaigns aimed at addressing global challenges and fostering positive change. These initiatives span various sectors such as humanitarian aid, sustainable development, education, healthcare, and environmental conservation.

There are different user types engaging with the IAC website, each bringing their unique perspectives, needs, and levels of familiarity with the campaigns and programs. Among these users are newcomers, individuals who are discovering the breadth and depth of the IAC's initiatives for the first time. These newcomers may include students researching global issues, concerned citizens seeking ways to make a difference, or professionals interested in expanding their philanthropic involvement. For them, the website serves as a gateway to explore the various sectors addressed by the IAC, from humanitarian aid to environmental conservation, offering them insights into the pressing challenges facing communities worldwide and the innovative solutions being implemented.

Additionally, returning users form another significant segment of the website's audience. These individuals have previously engaged with the IAC's campaigns or programs and are likely more familiar with its mission and objectives. Returning users may include volunteers who have participated in past initiatives, donors who have supported fundraising efforts, or activists who have advocated for policy changes. For these users, the website serves as a hub for staying updated on the latest developments within their areas of interest, accessing resources for ongoing involvement, and discovering new opportunities for engagement. Whether they're browsing for updates on ongoing projects, seeking ways to deepen their involvement, or sharing their experiences with others, returning users play a vital role in sustaining the momentum of the IAC's efforts and driving continued positive change.

Moreover, the diversity of user types extends beyond just newcomers and returning users. Within these broad categories exist nuances in user preferences, behaviors, and motivations that influence how they interact with the website and engage with the campaigns and programs. Some users may be drawn to interactive features that allow them to explore data visualizations or participate in virtual events, while others may prefer straightforward access to informational resources or opportunities for direct action. By understanding and accommodating these diverse user needs, the IAC website can effectively serve as a dynamic platform for connecting individuals with meaningful ways to contribute to global progress and create lasting impact in communities worldwide.

### 1. New Users

New users represent individuals who are just beginning their journey with the campaign. These users often require guidance to navigate the plethora of information and opportunities available. Providing clear pathways and introductory materials tailored to their needs is essential to ensure they can effectively understand and engage with the campaign's objectives.

Among new users, there are those who are tech-savvy and accustomed to digital platforms. For these individuals, offering user-friendly interfaces and interactive tools can enhance their experience and facilitate their exploration of the IAC's programs and campaigns.

### 2. Returning Users

In contrast, returning users are individuals who have already interacted with the IAC in some capacity. They may range from those casually browsing for updates to those actively seeking opportunities to contribute or take action. For returning users who are browsing around, providing easily accessible updates, highlights of recent activities, and suggestions for further engagement can keep them informed and involved.

On the other hand, returning users who are ready to take action represent a valuable segment of the campaign's audience. These individuals are motivated to make a difference and may be seeking opportunities for volunteering, fundraising, or advocacy. Tailoring the user experience to this group involves providing clear calls to action, facilitating easy access to relevant resources, and offering personalized support to help them channel their enthusiasm into meaningful contributions to the IAC's initiatives.

## Problems to Solve

### User Journeys

There are two major goals defined for users.

#### 1. Get educated about IAC and it's many programs.

Within the framework of the IAC, one of the primary objectives is to guide users towards relevant resources and opportunities. This includes directing individuals to specific programs, organizations, and platforms where they can access further information or get involved in meaningful ways.

User interface (UI) design plays a crucial role in enhancing the user experience when engaging with content related to the IAC. By implementing intuitive and visually appealing interfaces, users can navigate through information more easily and enjoyably. This not only improves accessibility but also encourages active participation and exploration of the campaign's objectives and offerings.

#### 2. Make donations for campaigns.

- IAC has many types of campaigns
- optimised process flow for different types of campaign, for different user types. ~~fml~~ challenge accepted!
- introduce filters
  - works for one module, need more thoughts on another

The International Aid Campaign (IAC) is characterized by its diverse array of campaigns, each designed to tackle specific global issues and drive positive change in communities around the world. These campaigns span a wide range of focus areas, including humanitarian aid, disaster relief, sustainable development, education, healthcare, environmental conservation, and social justice initiatives.

To effectively manage the multitude of campaigns within the IAC, an optimized process flow is implemented to cater to the needs and preferences of different user types. This tailored approach ensures that each campaign is strategically structured to maximize engagement and impact across various demographics and user segments.

For instance, campaigns targeting new users are carefully designed with a focus on simplicity and accessibility. The process flow for these campaigns is streamlined to provide clear guidance and support for individuals who are just beginning to familiarize themselves with the IAC's mission and objectives. User-friendly interfaces, informative resources, and interactive tools are incorporated to facilitate a smooth and engaging experience for newcomers.

In contrast, campaigns aimed at returning users are crafted to accommodate a more diverse range of engagement levels and interests. The process flow for these campaigns may offer greater flexibility and customization options to cater to the preferences of users who are already familiar with the IAC's initiatives. Whether users are casually browsing for updates or actively seeking opportunities for involvement, the process flow is optimized to provide relevant information and resources tailored to their needs.

Furthermore, the process flow for different types of campaigns within the IAC may vary based on the specific objectives and target audience of each initiative. For example, campaigns focused on fundraising may emphasize clear calls to action and streamlined donation processes, while advocacy campaigns may prioritize educational content and opportunities for grassroots activism.

By optimizing the process flow for different types of campaigns and user types, the IAC can effectively leverage its resources and engage a diverse audience in meaningful ways. This strategic approach ensures that each campaign is strategically designed to maximize impact and drive positive change on a global scale.
