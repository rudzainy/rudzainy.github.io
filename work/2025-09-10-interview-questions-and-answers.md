Name of Referrer (mark N/A if not applicable) *
When can you start? *

Clear
In the currency of your country, what are your monthly salary expectations? Please note your Recruiter may not have access to this information to avoid bias. *
RM8,000 to RM10,000 per month, preferably before tax.

How much experience in design do you have? What is a result that you are most proud of? *
I was doing mostly graphic and motion design before I graduated in IT and multimedia, which was when I transitioned into web design and now digital product design. Although I know there's still much to learn, I have now become quite comfortable discussing and debating design ideas. I would say the current iteration of my personal website (WIP at https://rudzainy.github.io) is what I am most proud of! After being so comfortable with modern web development frameworks, I never thought I would want to write in plain HTML CSS JS site again lolz

This is a role where you need to communicate with clients. We don’t just deisgn, we deliver! Can you share examples that demonstrate this is the right role for you? *
Absolutely! In my previous role as Platform Designer at Ace Resource Advisory Services, I had the unique opportunity to work in a team to revive a previously failed project. Our team understood immediately the extreme importance of the project for the client, and within a week-long workshop, we managed to iron out all requirements and produced a series of Figma prototypes that resulted in the revival of the project.

What is the book that has had the most profound impact on your career, and why? *
Don't Make Me Think by Steve Krug. It's amazing to be able to read, in comprehensible words, what I have been feeling along my professional career journey!

Question	Answer

Professional Journey – Tell us about a pivotal moment in your career that shaped how you approach design today.

Learning full-stack web development taught me that design can also be broken down into reusable, systematic components, much like development. This realization made me see design less as isolated visuals and more as a living system that can evolve and scale.

What changed in your thinking or process?

I began to view functional designs as modular, like Lego bricks that can be assembled and reused across different projects. As digital products matured, I saw how design patterns could be adapted and reused, which led to more efficient and consistent outcomes.

How has this influenced your work since then?

Looking back now, I’ve consistently applied componentization and clear separation of concerns in managing design assets. Design systems are now a core part of my workflow to ensure projects remain scalable and maintainable.

Role Alignment – What aspects of our team and work excite you the most?

I’m most excited about the opportunity to learn from Stampede’s collective experience and to contribute to end-to-end projects. Being part of a team that values collaboration and design-driven outcomes motivates me, and I’d love to contribute to the team’s continued success!

How does this align with your career aspirations?

My aspiration is to grow into a design leadership role where I can influence product strategy and mentor others. Looking in from the outside, Stampede’s environment, where designers are empowered to shape products holistically, aligns perfectly with my goal to deepen my craft while building leadership skills.

What unique perspective would you bring to these areas?

Having worked across design, development, and product ownership, I can bring a holistic perspective that bridges technical feasibility, user needs, and business goals. I can empathize with developers because I’ve shipped code, and I can structure design processes to align with business outcomes. This allows me to advocate for solutions that are both elegant and practical.

Growth & Development – Share a specific skill or area where you currently excel and could help others develop.

I excel at turning ambiguity into structure. From workshops to wireframes, I help teams clarify messy requirements and transform them into testable, reusable design assets. I can support others in learning how to approach complex problems methodically and design systems that scale.

And a specific skill or area you would like to grow and why this matters to you.

I want to grow in design leadership, especially in facilitating cross-functional collaboration at scale. This matters because impactful design requires more than great visuals — it requires building shared understanding and alignment across teams. Developing this skill will make me a stronger contributor in complex, multi-stakeholder projects.

Team Impact – Tell us about a time when you helped improve how your team works together. What did you do?

At Ace Resources, I noticed design files and feedback were scattered, which slowed down progress. I introduced a lightweight design system in Figma, created structured asset libraries, and set up weekly syncs so designers, developers, and product managers had a single source of truth.

How did it affect the team dynamic?

The team became more aligned and less stressed. I noticed handoffs were smoother, feedback loops were faster, and junior designers gained confidence knowing their work fit into a clear framework.

C.1. Case Study – Design System: What would you do differently if you were to rebuild the last design system you worked on today?

I would focus more on adoption rather than just documentation. While the system was robust, not everyone embraced it fully. Today, I would run onboarding sessions, create simple “how-to” guides, and gather continuous feedback. I’d also leverage automation (tokens, plugins) to reduce manual effort and make adoption frictionless for both designers and developers.

Case Study – Content Strategy: Describe a situation where you had to significantly revise a content strategy. What made you realise the original strategy wasn’t working?

At Rev Asia, the content strategy initially focused on SEO-heavy articles. While traffic was strong, analytics showed high bounce rates and low engagement. This revealed that the content didn’t resonate with readers despite attracting clicks.

How did you ensure the content was accessible to different user groups?

The editorial team shifted towards storytelling and we also focused on mobile-first readability. I worked with editors to streamline content structure, add visual aids, and design layouts optimized for phone usage, which was the dominant traffic source.

What specific metrics or feedback informed your revision?

Rev has an amazing growth team. Together, we tracked time on page, scroll depth, and social shares. Reader surveys also highlighted a preference for digestible, relatable stories instead of keyword-heavy articles.

How did you convince stakeholders to support the change?

We presented side-by-side comparisons showing that revised content retained readers longer and generated more shares. Framing the results in terms of increased ad revenue potential secured stakeholder buy-in.

Case Study – Impact & Learning: Describe a mistake or failure from this project. What went wrong and why?

In the EEZEE JOB project, I designed and built the app to a functional level, but the client had no clear monetization strategy. While the product worked and I was paid for the work, it felt like a missed opportunity; the effort invested didn’t translate into something sustainable. The mistake was not pushing early enough for clarity on business goals and monetization before committing to design and development.

What did you do differently afterwards?

I learned to validate business viability alongside user needs. Now, before investing time in design and development, I make it a priority to understand how a product will create and sustain value. This means aligning early on monetization, growth strategy, and success metrics. I’ve also found it important to be transparent with clients from the start (especially in highlighting how digital products differ from physical ones in terms of monetization) so expectations and strategies are set on solid ground.

What specific processes did you put in place to prevent similar issues?

I now include a “business viability checkpoint” in the discovery phase, asking key questions about revenue models, target markets, and scalability alongside user research and technical feasibility. This ensures design solutions are not only usable but also sustainable. While these conversations can be (for a lack of better word) delicate, I believe setting clear expectations early helps avoid wasted effort. And in cases with straightforward models like e-commerce, these questions are often already answered :)

C.2. Overall Experience – Craft: Tell us about your approach to learning and staying current in product design. What methods or resources do you use to develop your skills?

My approach is very hands-on. I often learn by watching YouTube channels where designers and builders share practical workflows, emerging tools, and case studies. More importantly, I apply what I learn immediately by building digital products that solve real-world problems (such as sama2.my, a community-driven platform I created to support people around me). This combination of continuous learning and real application keeps my skills current and grounded in practical outcomes.

Share a recent learning that changed how you work.	

Since ChatGPT first gained traction, I’ve been integrating AI into my design and development workflows. Their true value lies not in replacing creativity but in accelerating repetitive tasks like generating variations and testing accessibility. This shift allows me to spend more time on strategic and narrative aspects of design.

Community Impact – Tell us about your most meaningful contribution to your team and community. Outside of project work, how have you contributed?

Mentorship has been my most meaningful contribution. At NEXT Academy, I guided multiple cohorts of budding developers, teaching not only technical skills but also user-centered thinking. In professional teams, I often document processes, lead knowledge-sharing sessions, and help bridge gaps between design and development. Beyond work, I share my insights through blogs and community discussions, fostering a culture of learning and growth.

One of my most meaningful contributions was mentoring students during my time at NEXT Academy. I guided them in applying UX and product design principles through real examples, often using Hoojah, a debating platform I built, to demonstrate how ideas translate into working products. This experience reinforced my belief that impact comes from empowering others to learn and grow through practical, hands-on examples.
