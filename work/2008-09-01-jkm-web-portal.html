<p>CASE STUDY: Web Redesign for the Social Welfare Department of Malaysia</p>

<p>The Social Welfare Department of Malaysia (JKMM) is a governmental department that supports the people in need. It needs to provide services to its citizens and also has to face many challenges such as limited budget, limited manpower and other constraints. In this redesign process, I have identified some key areas where JKMM can improve their service delivery by making it more efficient and effective.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Disclaimers: 
1) This exercise started back in 2008, but was only written down in 2022. Some details might have been lost in time. 
2) This is meant to be a UI design exercise. Actual site data was not analysed as part of this design process.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In 2008, I joined a local web development company as a web designer. I was just starting out in my career and had only just begun to explore the world of web design anddevelopment. My general role was to design UI and convert it to HTML &amp; CSS. At that time, web development using open source CMS was on the rise in Malaysia. PHP and WAMP/LAMP stacks were popular backend solutions, and Joomla! 1.5 was the most commonly used content management system (CMS). The company did not have any designers on staff, so I worked closely with the developers to create their website and create mockups for each page.</p>

<p>My task was to come up with a new design for the Social Welfare Department website. This department has been around since 1957 and has lots of information about its services on its website. However, this information is not very accessible for users who are not familiar with what the site offers or how it works; they would need to scroll through many pages just to find out more about one particular service (e.g., applying for a job).</p>

<p>The goal was not just redesigning the site but also improving its usability so that users can easily find what they’re looking for without having to go through multiple pages in search results or navigation menus.</p>

<p>The end design. This design has since been deprecated by JKMM.</p>

<p>New layout designed in 2017, based on gov.uk’s design language.</p>
