## Opening Statement

Sometime in July 2022, I got an interview invitation for a UIUX Designer position. After the first Zoom interview, I was given an assignment to be completed within a few days.

The assignment was to re-design and build a WordPress mockups for two websites. 

## Unpacking the Problem

I broke down the process into two parts â€“ design and code.

### Design

I didn't have much time to work with, therefore I chose to not focus on UI too much, as both websites have a distinct branding theme. I focused instead on solving UX problems such as information hierarchy and basic UIUX housecleaning.

### Code

I had to re-build the current theme and faced some challanges getting myself accustomed to how the WordPress theme author manages their codebase. I managed to convert the design from Figma into code utilizing plugins in Figma to optimize my process flow.

I did not get the job.

Good learning.
