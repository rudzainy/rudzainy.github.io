The Sync Café had no name anymore. Whatever sign once hung above its door had been replaced so many times that the owners eventually stopped bothering, leaving only a faded outline where letters used to be. Regulars called it Kedai Jam—the Clock Shop—though no one remembered why.

Nani hadn't been to a dual-render space in years. She'd forgotten the particular strangeness of it: the way the walls couldn't quite decide on a colour, the slight shimmer at the edges of tables where physical and virtual geometries disagreed. The coffee came in cups that existed in both realms, which meant they were expensive and never quite the right temperature.

She'd chosen a seat facing the door. Old habit. In her work, you learned to watch for arrivals.

Tommy arrived exactly on time, which surprised her. Auditors were usually late—power moves, small assertions of hierarchy. But he slid into the seat across from her at 3:47pm, exactly as agreed, carrying his own cup from the counter.

"You tracked me down," he said. Not a question.

"You ignored my report."

"I flagged it for review."

"You buried it."

He didn't deny this. Up close, he looked older than his file photo—or maybe just more tired. There were physical details the Stream smoothed away: the grey at his temples, the permanent crease between his eyebrows, the way his hands wrapped around his cup like he was trying to warm them despite the café's warmth.

He lived in the Solid, she remembered. Full-time. By choice.

"You requested this meeting," he said. "So talk."

Nani had rehearsed this. On the commute over, in the elevator to his office, in the seventeen minutes she'd waited in his sterile reception area before he'd suggested—insisted, really—that they go somewhere "less observed." She'd prepared arguments, data points, a careful escalation of evidence.

Instead, she said: "You've seen it too."

Tommy's expression didn't change. But his hands stilled on the cup.

"Seen what?"

"Don't."

A long pause. Around them, the café hummed with the ambient noise of two realities layered over each other—conversations happening in the Stream bleeding faintly into physical space, the clink of cups that were and weren't quite the same cups.

"Your report mentioned visual anomalies during Sync recovery," Tommy said, his voice flattening into professional detachment. "That's not uncommon. Pattern recognition errors under stress. The brain invents—"

"I've visited Encik Rehan. Three times since the incident."

Tommy blinked. "He's still in medical observation. Family only."

"I'm listed as his emergency responder. It grants access." Nani's hands were steady around her cup, but only through effort. "He's not the same."

"Sync trauma often causes—"

"He doesn't blink."

The words hung there. Tommy's professional mask flickered.

"People blink," Nani continued. "It's autonomic. You can't choose not to. But I sat with him for forty minutes two days ago, and he didn't blink once. He looked at me the whole time. Through me. Like he was seeing something behind my face."

"That could be neurological damage. Sync interruption can—"

"He spoke to me."

Tommy waited.

"He said: 'You reached in. It remembers. It always remembers now.'" Nani's voice didn't waver, but something cold moved behind her eyes. "And then he said my name. My full name. My grandmother's name for me, that I've never told anyone, that I've never put in any system. And he smiled."

The café seemed quieter now. Or maybe Nani had simply stopped hearing it.

"The man I pulled out of The Interval," she said, "is not entirely Encik Rehan anymore. Something came back with him. Or something stayed, and sent a copy."

"That's not possible."

"Then explain his Hours."

Tommy frowned. "What about them?"

"Check his balance. Before the incident and now."

Something shifted in Tommy's posture—the slight tension of a man who'd just been handed information he didn't expect. He pulled out a slim device, thumbed through screens. Nani watched his face as he found it.

"That's not..." He trailed off. Scrolled. Checked again.

"His balance is growing," Nani said. "He had 412 years accumulated before the incident. As of this morning, he has 467. He's gaining Hours while lying in a hospital bed, doing nothing. Almost a year's worth of subjective time every day. Where is it coming from?"

Tommy stared at his screen. The crease between his eyebrows had deepened into something closer to pain.

"That's not possible," he said again, but the words were hollow now.

"I know." Nani leaned forward. "So either the system is broken in a way no one's noticed, or something is feeding him. Giving him time. And I want to know why."

Tommy set down his device. His hands, Nani noticed, were no longer steady.

"Seven years ago," he said quietly, "I was search-and-rescue. Physical. A building collapse in Penang, old construction, seventeen people trapped. I went in during the aftershocks to pull a survivor and the floor gave out." He spoke like he was reading from a file. "I fell two stories into a Sync chamber. The impact triggered an emergency transition. My body was unconscious, so the system couldn't complete—I got stuck. Interval. Forty-seven seconds objective time."

Nani waited.

"I experienced it as three weeks."

The café noise seemed to recede. Nani was aware of her own heartbeat, the slight hum of the render engines struggling to keep both realities aligned.

"What did you see?"

Tommy's hands tightened on the table's edge. "I'm not going to tell you that."

"Why not?"

"Because I've spent seven years trying to believe it wasn't real." He met her eyes. "Your report is the first one that describes what I saw. The reaching. The assembling. The awareness."

"Then you know I'm not inventing this."

"I know you saw something. I don't know if it's the same something." He paused. "When I came out... I was the same. Still me. Whoever's in that hospital bed, wearing Rehan's face—you're saying he's not."

"I'm saying I don't know." Nani set down her cup. "But I want to find out. And I think you do too, or you wouldn't have brought me to a café with bad monitoring coverage."

Tommy almost smiled. "You noticed that."

"I notice things." She held his gaze. "Help me. Whatever's happening—whether Rehan is still in there, whether something else is using him, whether he's become some kind of... conduit—I can't figure it out alone. And you have access I don't. Audit trails. System logs. The data that shows where those Hours are coming from."

"If I pull those records, it'll flag both of us."

"We're probably already flagged. You said it yourself—certain words draw attention. My report had all of them."

Tommy was silent for a long moment. The café flickered slightly around them, the dual render struggling with some invisible load.

"I'll look into it," he said finally. "Quietly. But I'm not promising anything."

"I'm not asking for promises."

"What are you asking for?"

Nani considered the question. What was she asking for? Answers, obviously. But underneath that—underneath the professional concern and the medical mystery—there was something else. The reaching she'd felt in The Interval. The way it had known she was there. The way Rehan had looked at her in that hospital room, smiling with a mouth that had forgotten how smiles worked.

"I'm asking you to tell me I'm not alone in this," she said.

It wasn't what she'd planned to say. But it was true.

Tommy studied her for a long moment. Whatever he saw seemed to satisfy something—or at least, failed to trigger whatever caution had kept him silent for seven years.

"You're not alone," he said. "Whether that's good news or bad, I haven't decided yet."

He stood, leaving his coffee untouched.

"I'll be in touch within 48 hours. If I'm not—" He hesitated. "If I'm not, visit Rehan again. Ask him about me. See what he says."

"Why?"

"Because if something in The Interval is keeping track, it'll know we talked. And if Rehan is... connected to it, somehow..." He didn't finish the thought. "Just ask. And be careful what you tell him. I have a feeling he's not the only one listening."

He left. The door chimed in both realms, a half-second apart, the sound unable to fully sync.

Nani sat alone in the café that couldn't decide what it was, thinking about a man in a hospital bed who was accumulating lifetimes he would never live.

Her coffee had gone cold in both worlds.
