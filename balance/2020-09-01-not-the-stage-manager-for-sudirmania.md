How I Used Notion to Manage an Indie Theatre Production

Responsible for ensuring that all elements of the production come together seamlessly for the show.
  - Worked closely with the director, designers, and production team during 
    pre-production planning stage to understand the vision for the show and assist in 
    creating a production schedule.
  - Scheduling and running rehearsals, ensuring actors are on time and prepared, 
    coordinating with the director to facilitate the creative process, and keeping detailed 
    notes on blocking, cues, and technical requirements.
  - Served as a central point of communication between all members of the production 
    team, including designers, crew, and performers.
  - Keeping accurate records of all aspects of the production, including rehearsal 
    schedules, blocking diagrams, and technical cue sheets.
  - Resigned from position mid-production due to constraints during the pandemic.
