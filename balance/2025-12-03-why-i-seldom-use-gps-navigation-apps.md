I have Waze and Google Maps installed on my phone. They're excellent apps, genuinely useful pieces of technology. But here's the thing — I rarely use them for my regular drives.

It's not that I think I'm a better navigator than an algorithm processing real-time traffic data from millions of users. I'm not. It's that these apps don't know me.

## They Don't Know My Driving Preferences

GPS apps optimise for time or distance. Sometimes toll avoidance if you toggle that option. But my preferences are more nuanced than that.

I prefer wider roads even if they add a few minutes to my journey. I'd rather take a highway with gentle curves than a shortcut through narrow residential streets where I need to constantly watch for kids, cats, and cars reversing out of driveways. The app sees two routes of similar duration and picks one. I see two completely different driving experiences.

Some routes just feel better to drive. That smooth stretch of road with well-timed traffic lights. The scenic route along the coast that adds five minutes but subtracts stress. The app doesn't factor in how a route makes me feel.

## Actual Road Conditions Are Invisible to Algorithms

Sure, Waze knows about reported potholes and police presence. But it doesn't know that the left lane on that particular stretch of road has been patchy for months. It doesn't know that the road surface near that construction site turns into a muddy mess after rain. It doesn't know that the painted road markings at that junction have faded so badly that everyone gets confused at night.

These are things I've learned through experience. Local knowledge that no crowd-sourced app has captured yet. The algorithm sees a road. I see the actual road I've driven dozens of times.

## The Nuisances Only Locals Know

Every regular commuter knows the unofficial rules of their routes. That intersection where you need to be in the right lane early because nobody lets you merge later. That traffic light with the weird timing that creates a bottleneck. That stretch where motorcycles weave aggressively during rush hour.

The GPS might route me through an area I know to be chaotic at certain hours. It might suggest a turn at a junction I know is poorly designed. It might take me past that one spot where the road floods every time it rains heavily.

## When I Do Use GPS Navigation

Don't get me wrong — GPS navigation is brilliant for what it does. I absolutely use it when:

- **Going somewhere new.** No amount of local knowledge helps when I've never been there.
- **Avoiding known traffic jams.** When I know there's congestion ahead but don't know the detours, I let the app figure it out.
- **Long-distance drives.** On highways between cities, the app's suggestions are usually solid.
- **Finding specific addresses.** Especially in areas with confusing numbering systems.

## The Human Element

There's something to be said for knowing your routes. For building that mental map through experience. For making driving decisions based on factors no app can measure — your mood, your energy level, whether you want the fastest route or the most pleasant one.

GPS navigation apps are tools, and they're good at their job. But they solve for efficiency in ways that don't always align with how I want to experience my drive. They don't know that I'll happily add ten minutes to avoid a stressful stretch of road. They don't know that I find certain routes genuinely enjoyable.

So I keep the apps installed. I use them when I need them. But for my regular drives, I trust the navigation system that's been learning these roads for years — the one between my ears.
