<p>In the year 2023, I had the amazing opportunity to work as a platform designer in the agriculture industry. This meant diving deep into the world of plantations, processing, and manufacturing, with a mission to bring digital solutions to traditional practices. Our goal was to digitize everything – from managing plantations to processing crops, all with the power of digital technologies. Let me tell you, it was quite the adventure!</p>

<h2 id="the-shining">The Shining</h2>

<p>During the early requirement gathering stage, one issue kept popping up: user’s frustrations of dealing with screen brightness issues out in the fields. Ever tried using your phone outside on a sunny day? Than you know what I mean!</p>

<p>One solution that I proposed was implementing light and dark mode. Essentially, it allows users to switch between different display modes based on the lighting conditions. Whether it’s bright daylight or the dim of twilight, farmers can adjust the app to make it easier to see and use.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Some of the most important things are going to be <strong>high contrast, large text and dark on light design</strong>.</p>

<p>Another proposed solution was to use a mobile phone sun visor. This idea involves attaching a small, foldable sun visor to the phone, providing instant shade and reducing glare on the screen when working outdoors. Despite its simplicity, this solution has the potential to greatly enhance the lives of agricultural workers by offering a practical and cost-effective solution.</p>

<h2 id="straightening-things-up">Straightening Things Up</h2>

<p>After addressing the screen brightness issue, our next big challenge was consolidating nearly 20 diverse forms and workflows into a single app interface. It was like solving a massive puzzle! But through meticulous planning and out-of-the-box thinking, we cracked the code and devised a streamlined information architecture that catered to the needs of all users.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/img/posts/prioritised-form-s.gif" alt="video"></p>

<p>Our primary goal was to ensure that navigating the app felt like a breeze, even for those less familiar with technology. By carefully organizing and simplifying the user interface, we aimed to make complex tasks feel as effortless as slicing into a delicious pie, ensuring that every user could access the functionalities they needed with ease and confidence.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/img/posts/organize-forms-a-b.png" alt="20230504 - Quick sketches of idea to organize forms. On the left is using horizontal tabs menu. On the right is a fallback of using dropdown navigation."></p>

<p><img src="/assets/img/posts/organize-forms-c.png" alt="20230504 - Another idea is to use filters to prioritize certain forms (a.k.a. favourites, bookmark, featured etc.)"></p>

<p>The project encompasses involvement from various stakeholders across multiple subdivisions of the business, including but not limited to operations, research and development (R&amp;D), marketing, and business transformation.</p>

<h2 id="and-sync">And Sync</h2>

<p>But here’s where things got really interesting: dealing with almost no network connection in rural areas. Imagine trying to sync important data when there’s barely any signal! To solve this, I proposed a user flow for peer-to-peer syncing. This way, farmers could share information directly between their phones, even without an internet connection.</p>

<h2 id="etc">ETC.</h2>

<p>Of course, it wasn’t all smooth sailing. We ran into some design limitations along the way, thanks to pesky tech issues, budget constraints, and all the red tape that comes with big projects. But hey, every challenge is an opportunity to learn and grow, right?</p>

<p>Looking ahead, we’ve got some exciting ideas for the future of the app. One thing we’re really pumped about is adding gamification elements. Picture this: turning everyday tasks into fun challenges, complete with rewards and achievements. Who knew farming could be so much fun?</p>

<p>And let’s not forget about making the app even easier to use with intuitive gestures like tapping and swiping instead of typing. It’s all about making technology work for us, not the other way around!</p>

<h2 id="famous-last-words">Famous Last Words</h2>

<blockquote>
  <p>Have <strong>real users test the site</strong> on a sunny day in direct sun; they’ll be able to tell you if your site is reasonably readable. Try a couple different models of phone as well if possible. You or your design team will know what they’re looking for on the site and be able to parse things a new user might not. A fresh look is important.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>At the time when I left, some solutions presented has not been tested on the field. All in all, it’s been a wild ride, full of challenges and triumphs, but one thing’s for sure: the future of farming is looking brighter than ever, thanks to the power of digital innovation!</p>
