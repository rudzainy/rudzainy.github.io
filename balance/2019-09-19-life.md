It's very easy to say yes <br /> 
&nbsp;and take actions for something that,  <br /> 
&nbsp;in your heart,  <br /> 
&nbsp;you truly believe is right. <br /> 
There's zero doubt. <br /> 
No regrets.

It's not so easy though  <br /> 
&nbsp;to say yes  <br /> 
&nbsp;and choose the lesser evil  <br /> 
&nbsp;between two wrongs.  <br /> 
However,   <br /> 
&nbsp;deep down  <br /> 
&nbsp;you believe that actions  <br /> 
&nbsp;need to be taken. <br /> 
You dip your hands  <br /> 
&nbsp;into the gutter.

It has to be done. <br /> 
You take  <br /> 
&nbsp;every  <br /> 
&nbsp;bit  <br /> 
&nbsp;of responsibility  <br /> 
&nbsp;for your actions.

It's even harder to stay silent. <br /> 
Because you know that you will never be able to live with yourself  <br /> 
&nbsp;if you say yes  <br /> 
&nbsp;to a wrong.  <br /> 
You understand  <br /> 
&nbsp;that you may never find peace. <br /> 
But you endure,  <br /> 
&nbsp;keeping everything inside until one day,  <br /> 
&nbsp;hopefully,  <br /> 
&nbsp;your silence is heard.

Ultimately,  <br /> 
&nbsp;the decision is yours alone to make.  <br /> 
&nbsp;Do what you believe in your heart is right. <br /> 
When you do,  <br /> 
&nbsp;God willing,  <br /> 
&nbsp;it will be the right decision.
