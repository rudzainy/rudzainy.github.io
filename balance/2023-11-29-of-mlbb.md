- Last night (27.4.24) my wife and I went to a family raya open house. 
- My nephew know I play. He asked to play a game with me

## 1. Intro: A brief explanation of the game and why it's so popular.

MLBB is an electrifying game that has captured the hearts of gamers worldwide with its thrilling combat and diverse roster of heroes. Players engage in fierce 5v5 matches, utilizing heroes with unique powers and battling opponents in real-time. The game has become renowned for its cutthroat gameplay, wide selection of heroes, and dedicated community that competes in high-stakes esports tournaments. To succeed in this game, a well-honed strategy and superb teamwork are crucial. In the next section, we'll explore why these elements are so vital in ensuring victory in MLBB.

## 2. Why I Play

- I played a lot of (video, computer, handheld) games in the past. My fav genre is immersive role playing games.
- While I was in school, games like Starcraft and Dota became popular. 
  - Those games were too long to finish.

### The thrill of objective-based gameplay.

The focus on completing objectives, rather than just racking up kills, adds a layer of strategy and depth to the game. As a Ruby main, I love the challenge of capturing objectives like the Lord and the Turtle. It's satisfying to work together with my team to secure these objectives and give our team an edge in the match.

### The short match length.

MLBB's quick matches make it perfect for players who don't have a lot of time to spare but still want to get a quick gaming fix. As someone who likes fast-paced action, the 10-30 minute match length of MLBB is perfect for me. It allows me to get a quick game in without having to commit hours at a time.

### The opportunity for individual performance.

The game allows players to showcase their skills and stand out from the crowd. Harith's mobility and damage output allow me to take down enemies and make a real impact on the game. Being able to showcase my skills and contribute to my team's success is a huge rush.

### The sense of competition.

The ranked mode and esports tournaments provide a platform for players to test their mettle against others and see where they stand in the community. I'm not that ambitions, so I stay in ranked mode and occasionally participate in the weekly tournaments if I have free entrance tickets.

### The satisfaction of a comeback victory.

Nothing beats the feeling of coming back from a seemingly insurmountable disadvantage to snatch the win! When you're down and out, and then you pull off an epic comeback, it's like you're a gaming superhero. ðŸ˜Ž As a Ruby player, I've had some epic comeback victories where I've turned the tides of battle and led my team to victory. It's those moments that keep me coming back to MLBB again and again.

## 3. The Sports in E-sports

In many ways, esports, including MLBB, share similarities with traditional physical sports when it comes to generational advantages. Here's a few key points:

1. **Reaction Time and Motor Skills**: Just like in physical sports, esports require quick reaction times and precise motor skills. Younger generations often have an edge in these areas due to factors like faster neural processing and adaptability to new technologies.

2. **Learning Curve**: Esports, like traditional sports, have a learning curve where players need to understand game mechanics, strategies, and meta trends. Younger players may adapt more quickly to these aspects, as they tend to spend more time playing and learning from a younger age.

3. **Flexibility and Adaptability**: Esports, especially competitive titles like MLBB, undergo regular updates and patches that introduce new features, balance changes, and gameplay mechanics. Younger players may find it easier to adapt to these changes and innovate new strategies compared to older players who might be more set in their ways.

4. **Time and Dedication**: Esports, similar to physical sports, require dedication, practice, and time commitment to excel. Younger players often have more free time and fewer responsibilities compared to adults, allowing them to dedicate more hours to honing their skills.

5. **Evolving Meta**: Just like in physical sports, esports have a constantly evolving meta-game where certain strategies, heroes, or playstyles become more dominant over time. Younger players may have a better grasp of these meta shifts and adapt accordingly, giving them an advantage over older players who might struggle to keep up with the latest trends.

However, it's important to note that experience, strategic thinking, teamwork, and leadership skills are also crucial in esports, and these qualities can often compensate for any age-related disadvantages. 

Additionally, older players may bring valuable experience from other aspects of life, such as decision-making under pressure or effective communication, which can be advantageous in competitive gaming. 

Ultimately, success in esports, much like in physical sports, is a combination of various factors, and age is just one of them.

### Advantage of playing together

We played together in the same physical space. Playing MLBB together in person as opposed to remotely offers several advantages:

1. **Improved Communication**: Playing in person allows for real-time, face-to-face communication among team members. This can enhance coordination, strategy discussions, and quick decision-making during matches.

2. **Team Bonding**: Being physically present with teammates fosters a stronger sense of camaraderie and teamwork. Sharing the same physical space can strengthen relationships and trust, which can positively impact gameplay.

3. **Immediate Feedback**: In-person play enables instant feedback and adjustment. Teammates can provide feedback on gameplay, strategies, and individual performances more effectively, leading to quicker skill improvement.

4. **Reduced Latency and Connectivity Issues**: Playing together in person eliminates potential issues related to internet connectivity and latency that can occur when playing remotely. This ensures a smoother gaming experience with minimal disruptions.

5. **Enhanced Focus**: Being in the same physical space can help minimize distractions and promote focus on the game. Players can maintain better concentration, leading to improved performance and decision-making during matches.

6. **Quick Reaction Times**: With everyone in close proximity, communication and reactions can be faster compared to remote play. This can be crucial in fast-paced games like MLBB, where split-second decisions can determine the outcome of a match.

7. **Shared Resources**: In-person play allows for easy sharing of resources such as gaming equipment, strategies, and tips. Players can exchange ideas and techniques more efficiently, leading to mutual skill development.

8. **Social Interaction**: Playing together in person provides opportunities for social interaction beyond the game itself. Players can engage in casual conversations, bonding activities, and post-game analysis, strengthening friendships and team dynamics.

While playing remotely also offers convenience and flexibility, particularly for players who are geographically distant, playing together in person can provide unique advantages that contribute to a more immersive and rewarding gaming experience, especially in competitive environments like MLBB.





As you can see from the replays, we were not really playing competetively. However, with deep understanding of objective game playing, we managed to take advantage of the gameplay and won the game.


### Taking advantage of gameplay

Winning in Mobile Legends: Bang Bang (MLBB) requires a combination of individual skill, teamwork, strategy, and adaptability. 

Strong strategy is the foundation of a winning MLBB team. Knowing when to engage and disengage, push objectives, and retreat is crucial. Players must be able to make strategic decisions on the fly, and adapt to changing battlefield conditions. Effective communication is also key, allowing players to coordinate their actions and communicate their plans clearly.

Effective teamwork is the key to victory in MLBB. A well-coordinated team can be a force to be reckoned with, moving in perfect sync and using their abilities to complement each other's strengths. Communication is the glue that holds it all together, allowing players to work together as a cohesive unit and defeat the opposing team. In the heat of battle, strong teamwork can make all the difference!

Here are some key gameplay strategies to help you secure victory:

1. **Team Composition**: Choose heroes that complement each other's strengths and cover each other's weaknesses. Aim for a balanced team composition with roles like tanks, marksmen, mages, assassins, and supports.

2. **Map Awareness**: Keep an eye on the mini-map to track enemy movements, objectives, and potential ganks. Map awareness allows you to make informed decisions, rotate effectively, and anticipate enemy strategies.

3. **Objective Control**: Prioritize objectives such as turrets, jungle monsters, and the Lord or Turtle. Securing objectives provides gold, experience, and map control, giving your team an advantage in the game.

4. **Lane Management**: Maintain proper lane equilibrium by last-hitting minions, pushing lanes when appropriate, and rotating to help teammates in need. Proper lane management ensures consistent gold and experience income while denying resources to the enemy team.

5. **Vision Control**: Place wards strategically to provide vision and map control. Vision allows you to spot enemy movements, set up ambushes, and secure objectives safely.

6. **Effective Rotations**: Rotate with your team to respond to threats, secure kills, and take objectives. Coordinate rotations through clear communication and map pings to maximize efficiency and map pressure.

7. **Teamfights and Positioning**: Position yourself correctly during teamfights to maximize your impact and minimize risks. Focus on high-priority targets, protect your carries, and utilize crowd control abilities effectively to turn the tide of battle in your favor.

8. **Itemization**: Adapt your item build to counter the enemy team composition and capitalize on their weaknesses. Prioritize core items for your hero's role and adjust your build according to the flow of the game.

9. **Communication and Coordination**: Maintain clear communication with your team throughout the game. Coordinate strategies, call out enemy positions, and make decisive shot calls to maintain control and momentum.

10. **Stay Positive and Adapt**: Stay positive, even in challenging situations, and adapt your strategy as the game progresses. Learn from mistakes, capitalize on enemy errors, and maintain a proactive mindset to secure victory.

By mastering these gameplay strategies and working closely with your team, you can increase your chances of winning matches in Mobile Legends: Bang Bang.
